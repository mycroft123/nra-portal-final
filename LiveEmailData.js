'Fast and Furious' by Katie Pavlich. This book clearly delineates the level of criminality and blatant lying cover-up of illegal scheming of our federal government to&nbsp; supply illegal arms\r\n to Mexican drug cartels.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp; &nbsp;Ms. Pavlich lays out the plans of Eric Holder and Barack Obama to force gun dealers (legal businessmen) in the U.S. to forge sales paperwork and sell guns to the cartels. This went on for quite a while. A Border Patrol agent was subsequently\r\n killed with one of these illegal firearms.</div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp; &nbsp;The lies and deniability of Obama and Holder were grounds for impeachment if they were to become known........they were not.</div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp; &nbsp;We have at present a pro second amendment president but we know the gears are grinding in the anti-gun camp for future assaults on our second amendment. They are planning on how to cheat themselves back into power.</div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp; &nbsp;I feel it would be beneficial to all gun owners if your magazines put a small blip in the publications advocating all second amendment advocates to read this book. I have absolutely no fiduciary interest in this book but consider it a must\r\n read for those interested in how low our 'government' can stoop to deny citizens constitutional rights.</div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\" data-setdir=\"false\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sid Gammon</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n"

My father introduced me to hunting and fishing at a very early age, and I've done the\r\n same with my son and grandson. Looking back forty years or so, Mario Cuomo was the governor of New York State. His ego was as large as his liberalism, and he enjoyed sparing with the media at almost daily press conferences, where he would expound on the superiority\r\n of his policies and ideas. The press conference that is still fresh in my mind was about gun control. Reporters were asking about self defense, the shooting sports and other aspects of owning a gun. His outlook was that no one should own a gun. One reporter\r\n asked about hunters. His reply? &quot;All hunters want to do is drink beer and cheat on their wives.&quot; And he was serious. He tried (lamely) to walk it back the next day, but by then I had joined the NRA.</div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\" data-setdir=\"false\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\" data-setdir=\"false\">Back then I realized that many people didn't approve of gun ownership, but it didn't really affect me personally until I realized the governor of my state might be coming after my guns. At that time the NRA required a sponsor\r\n to join. A neighbor gladly obliged, and I've been an annual member almost continually since then. I dropped my membership for a period of time since although I firmly believe the NRA is one of the only organizations (the New York Rifle and Pistol Association\r\n being another) that will stand and fight for my second amendment rights. Back then I was raising a family and scratching to make ends meet. So I deleted a few memberships and subscriptions for a few years until I was better able to afford them.</div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\" data-setdir=\"false\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\" data-setdir=\"false\">I worked in New York State government for thirty years and witnessed bureaucracy that at times was horrible and at other times promising Towards the end of my career I worked for a commissioner who, like you, asked for input.\r\n And he got it. His method of addressing problems was not to criticize or attack persons bringing subjects to his attention but rather to ask staff to work together to solve them. His message? Where do we have opportunities for improvement? A slightly different\r\n twist on the question of what 's wrong in our organization and who's to blame for it.</div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\" data-setdir=\"false\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\" data-setdir=\"false\">It's in this sprit of looking for opportunities for improvement that I offer a few observations for you to consider. First, I realize you need money to survive and carry out your mission. Every (and I mean every) piece of\r\n mail I get from you, whether it be from the main organization or a sub group like the NRA-ILA, is asking for donations. It's a common complaint I hear in the fall, and is one reason people are hesitant to join. (&quot;All they want is money, and I don't know what\r\n they do with it&quot;) I point out that the America Hunter magazine has sections devoted to NRA activities such as court challenges and regional information around the country and I also make sure there are several copies of this magazine lying around my hunting\r\n camp.</div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\" data-setdir=\"false\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\" data-setdir=\"false\">While I think of it, I have often wished I had some window decals for my vehicles. You used to send them with my annual membership renewal but with your often offered multi-year membership deals that seems to have fallen by\r\n the wayside. But wait, you say. You can go to the NRA store and get some. I don't think paying $6.95 for a small window decal and then shelling out $10.95 to ship it is a very good deal. &quot;I'm the NRA and I vote!&quot; was a good one but has since come off with\r\n many washings.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\" data-setdir=\"false\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\" data-setdir=\"false\">Lastly I would like to encourage the NRA to once again have regional offices at least in those states where the attack on the second amendment is most egregious. Again, I realize this takes money, but here in New York we are\r\n faced with Governor Hochul who has taken gun control to an entirely new level with passage of the Safe Act and accompanying legislation. There used to be an office in Albany that was helpful to me years ago. Perhaps you could work something out with the NY\r\n Rifle and Pistol Association. Just a thought.</div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\" data-setdir=\"false\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\" data-setdir=\"false\">Before I fire off a note to J. Scott Olmstead about missing the point in a letter he received about squirrel hunting last month, I want to wish you luck in your new endeavor. No need to respond to this. Glad to get it off\r\n my chest.</div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\" data-setdir=\"false\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\" data-setdir=\"false\">Kenneth Goeldner</div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\" data-setdir=\"false\">000018670846</div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\" data-setdir=\"false\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n"

We've also been told about the &quot;vast&quot; changes that have taken place\r\n since then, as well as transparency and accountability reforms. </div>\r\n<div class=\"default-style\" style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;\">\r\n&nbsp; </div>\r\n<div class=\"default-style\" style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;\">\r\nWe've also have been told about changes in leadership and board members, and have been given a clarion call to &quot;reach out to new members&quot; to support the organization--and, by association, support the Second Amendment itself.\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"default-style\" style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;\">\r\n&nbsp; </div>\r\n<div class=\"default-style\" style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;\">\r\nAs a strong supporter of the Second Amendment, and NRA, what is troubling to read/hear are all of the &quot;issues&quot; that have happened with the NRA organization, and subsequent &quot;redemption&quot;--though, without being told ANY specifics. The &quot;redemption&quot; and ongoing\r\n revisions have been discussed in more than a few months of publications.&nbsp; </div>\r\n<div class=\"default-style\" style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;\">\r\n&nbsp; </div>\r\n<div class=\"default-style\" style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;\">\r\nAs an example--in your words--&quot;For far too long, however, past NRA leadership did not do as good of a job as it should have. The status quo managed to drown you out, leaving your concerns and ideas unheard and unheeded. That has all changed.&quot; (July 2025 Shooting\r\n Illustrated.) </div>\r\n<div class=\"default-style\" style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;\">\r\n&nbsp; </div>\r\n<div class=\"default-style\" style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;\">\r\nQuestions remain: </div>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li class=\"default-style\" style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;\">\r\nWho *specifically* misused NRA members' contributions? </li><li class=\"default-style\" style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;\">\r\nHow many people were involved. </li><li class=\"default-style\" style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;\">\r\nWhat were the *specific* instances of malfeasance? </li><li class=\"default-style\" style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;\">\r\nWhy do members have to hear about NRA improprieties from media outlets--AND, invariably, from outlets who oppose the NRA and the Second Amendment?!\r\n</li><li class=\"default-style\" style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;\">\r\nThis is the *second* group of NRA leadership administrators who came after Wayne LaPierre resigned. What happened to the first group?\r\n</li><li class=\"default-style\" style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;\">\r\nWhy did Bob Barr leave? </li><li class=\"default-style\" style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;\">\r\nWhy isn't Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North associated with NRA leadership anymore? I've read the Wikipedia account. But, that doesn't explain why he isn't back after changes have been made.\r\n</li><li class=\"default-style\" style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;\">\r\nIn prior publications NRA members have been admonished for not using our voting rights to elect members. Reason: WE DON'T KNOW THEM! How about providing a forum (online) where we can see/hear these prospective directors/administrators present themselves and\r\n their viewpoints?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</li><li class=\"default-style\" style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;\">\r\nAGAIN, why do members have to find out ANY *specific* details about major NRA changes through the media or Wikipedia, INSTEAD OF THROUGH THE NRA itself?!\r\n</li><li class=\"default-style\" style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;\">\r\nLastly, this has nothing to do with the points above; however, to save time, I'll state it here: I (like many others) will miss Wiley Clapp and his &quot;Fightin' Iron&quot; articles. I always looked forward to reading them! The space in &quot;Shooting Illustrated&quot; after\r\n he left is left wanting.

I joined the NRA shortly after graduation in 1968.&nbsp; &nbsp;Not\r\n sure the real reason, but they had a neat magazine (American Rifleman) that all of my shooting buddies read every month.&nbsp; This was back when you had to have another member sponsor you for joining,...and back when they published the names of the winners of\r\n all those gun raffles the following month after the raffle was over.&nbsp; &nbsp;I never met another member that ever won anything from the NRA.&nbsp; &nbsp;There were the Cincinnati accords, the birth of the ILA, and later the shakeup there.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div style=\"font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif;

as LaPierre called them), 35 years\r\n volunteering in Scouting, NRA Rifle, Shotgun, and RSO qualified, high school coach on shotgun team, current South Carolina Hunter Education instructor, and years of range service at scout camps in the summer.&nbsp;

&nbsp;He should have been relieved immediately, even with only a few days left in the White\r\n House.&nbsp; &nbsp; And yet, not a word from the NRA other than praise....and to have his picture on the front cover of their publications just prior to the election??...that was too much.&nbsp;

The old ways of marketing, by the NRA, has become old, stale and not very effective. This is 2025 and the NRA needs to embrace what this new age of computers, AI, social media and new age marketing\r\n has to offer. Below are some ideas worth considering to get the NRA back to its glory days.</p>\r\n<p class=\"gmail-MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0in 0.5in;line-height:115%;font-size:14pt;font-family:&quot;Arial Rounded MT Bold&quot;,sans-serif\">\r\n1.<span style=\"font-variant-numeric:normal;font-variant-east-asian:normal;font-variant-alternates:normal;font-size-adjust:none;font-kerning:auto;font-feature-settings:normal;font-stretch:normal;font-size:7pt;line-height:normal;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n</span>Have every gun store, brick &amp; mortar and online, a voice of the NRA. In my previous email, I mentioned how to set up a website that any retail outlet can access, to enter a member’s NRA number to get an immediate discount of their purchase and to reimburse\r\n the dealer. Since every membership these days (think Amazon, Costco, Sam’s Club, Walmart&#43;, etc.) pay an annual fee to be a member, charge every retailer and FFL dealer an annual fee of (e.g.) $120 to offer the NRA discount and to receive banners and posters\r\n about being proud members of the NRA. Use these annual fees to defray the cost of the website and to cover the X% discount for being an NRA member.</p>\r\n<p class=\"gmail-MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0in 0.5in;line-height:115%;font-size:14pt;font-family:&quot;Arial Rounded MT Bold&quot;,sans-serif\">\r\n2.<span style=\"font-variant-numeric:normal;font-variant-east-asian:normal;font-variant-alternates:normal;font-size-adjust:none;font-kerning:auto;font-feature-settings:normal;font-stretch:normal;font-size:7pt;line-height:normal;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n</span>Offer the participating retailers and FFLs an inside track to NRA supported credit card processing services, business bank accounts by supporting banks, business insurance, liability insurance, internet services, etc. Any service needed for a business\r\n to operate can be offered to an NRA supporting retail business. This is similar to the NRA insurance offered to gun ranges and clubs where its members are all NRA members.</p>\r\n<p class=\"gmail-MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0in 0.5in;line-height:115%;font-size:14pt;font-family:&quot;Arial Rounded MT Bold&quot;,sans-serif\">\r\n3.<span style=\"font-variant-numeric:normal;font-variant-east-asian:normal;font-variant-alternates:normal;font-size-adjust:none;font-kerning:auto;font-feature-settings:normal;font-stretch:normal;font-size:7pt;line-height:normal;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n</span>Offer, at the retail outlets, an NRA Visa/Master Card underwritten by an internet bank that specializes in the new credit/light credit market. These finance companies offer credit cars with a limited $500 to $1000 credit limit for new credit buyers.\r\n Use the gun purchase as collateral (unenforceable) and give these retail shops a way to sell more guns to more people or to upsell a buyer from a “cheap” purchase to a “better”one with a new credit card issued THRU a lender recognized by the NRA. Of course,\r\n a membership would also be needed to qualify but it can be added to the new credit card.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"gmail-MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0in 0.5in;line-height:115%;font-size:14pt;font-family:&quot;Arial Rounded MT Bold&quot;,sans-serif\">\r\n4.<span style=\"font-variant-numeric:normal;font-variant-east-asian:normal;font-variant-alternates:normal;font-size-adjust:none;font-kerning:auto;font-feature-settings:normal;font-stretch:normal;font-size:7pt;line-height:normal;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n</span>Make the NRA membership card a valuable commodity to the membership. For example, look at how the AARP offers its members hundreds of saving options. Have the NRA membership card be as valuable as an AARP card to the membership. Offer sponsored discounts\r\n to specific gas stations, restaurants, fast food joints, etc. For members on the go, visit a Cracker Barrel restaurant, present your NRA card and get a 10% discount on the food bill. The restaurant gets the increased business from NRA members because the NRA\r\n Rifleman magazine publishes a page(s) of sponsors that support the NRA and who we should patronize. NRA members are very supportive of those who believe in us. We are a loyal group. The NRA card can be digital as well as physical and can have a QR code to\r\n be used easily. This is 2025.</p>\r\n<p class=\"gmail-MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0in 0.5in;line-height:115%;font-size:14pt;font-family:&quot;Arial Rounded MT Bold&quot;,sans-serif\">\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"gmail-MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0in 0.5in;line-height:115%;font-size:14pt;font-family:&quot;Arial Rounded MT Bold&quot;,sans-serif\">\r\nBy making being an NRA member a privilege instead of just another bill, the NRA can become as big and powerful as any organization that provides value in membership. All it takes is some clever, 2025 type marketing, to get the ball rolling. With social media\r\n taking over, the right marketing can snowball immediate results.</p>\r\n<p class=\"gmail-MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0in 0.5in;line-height:115%;font-size:14pt;font-family:&quot;Arial Rounded MT Bold&quot;,sans-serif\">\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"gmail-MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0in 0.5in;line-height:115%;font-size:14pt;font-family:&quot;Arial Rounded MT Bold&quot;,sans-serif\">\r\nHowever, the core of the NRA mission must be front and center. That can never change but offering ways for the membership to save money is what it takes to get them to want to join us.</p>\r\n<p class=\"gmail-MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0in 0.5in;line-height:115%;font-size:14pt;font-family:&quot;Arial Rounded MT Bold&quot;,sans-serif\">\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"gmail-MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0in 0.5in;line-height:115%;font-size:14pt;font-family:&quot;Arial Rounded MT Bold&quot;,sans-serif\">\r\nLarry Hall</p>\r\n<p class=\"gmail-MsoListParagraphCxSpLast\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 10pt 0.5in;line-height:115%;font-size:14pt;font-family:&quot;Arial Rounded MT Bold&quot;,sans-serif\">\r\nPh)860-921-3791</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<br>\r\n<div class=\"gmail_quote gmail_quote_container\">\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\" class=\"gmail_attr\">On Mon, Jul 28, 2025 at 8:47 PM NRA President &lt;<a href=\"mailto:President@nradirector.com\">President@nradirector.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br>\r\n</div>\r\n<blockquote class=\"gmail_quote\" style=\"margin:0px 0px 0px 0.8ex;border-left:1px solid rgb(204,204,204);padding-left:1ex\">\r\n<div class=\"msg3564087945343882981\">\r\n<div lang=\"EN-US\">\r\n<div class=\"m_3564087945343882981WordSection1\">\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;color:rgb(31,73,125)\">Good evening Larry, thank you for writing and expressing your views.&nbsp; We need honest communications to fix problems and restore confidence!</span><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;color:rgb(31,73,125)\"><u></u><u></u></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a name=\"m_3564087945343882981__MailEndCompose\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;color:rgb(31,73,125)\"><u></u>&nbsp;<u></u></span></a></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;color:rgb(31,73,125)\">Not sure where to start so I’m embedding my responses.<u></u><u></u></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;color:rgb(31,73,125)\"><u></u>&nbsp;<u></u></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">From:</span></b><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"> Larry Hall [mailto:<a href=\"mailto:larryh1108@gmail.com\" target=\"_blank\">larryh1108@gmail.com</a>]\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Sent:</b> Sunday, July 27, 2025 12:18 PM<br>\r\n<b>To:</b> NRA President &lt;President@NRADirector.com&gt;<br>\r\n<b>Subject:</b> Requested letter/suggestion<u></u><u></u></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><u></u>&nbsp;<u></u></p>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:10pt;line-height:115%\"><span style=\"font-size:13.5pt;line-height:115%;font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;color:rgb(70,71,74);background:rgb(248,248,248)\">Hi,</span><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Arial Rounded MT Bold&quot;,sans-serif\"><u></u><u></u></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:10pt;line-height:115%\"><span style=\"font-size:13.5pt;line-height:115%;font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;color:rgb(70,71,74);background:rgb(248,248,248)\">I am an NRA Benefactor Lifetime Member and have been for many years.\r\n I read and appreciate your letter to us in the August 2025 edition.

If you are a long time board member why didnt you assist in the previous attempts to oust Lapierre? There were some strong attempts to stop his stealing\r\n from the general funds and enriching himself and his cronies. The NRA used to be a viable organization but now its not on the political landscape. As soon as the NRA was turned into an arm of the Republican party it lost its clout. if you need me to remind\r\n you of all the foolish donations made by the NRA let me know. The NRA should be about gun ownership and the second amendment. the NRA should have 50 million plus members but you make it political. Democrats cannot attack the NRA if they have 10 mil plus members.\r\n You claim 20 to 30 mil claim to be NRA members but thats a pipe dream,. true membersiip is probably LESS THAN 3 MIL. Im a patriot life member at the benefactor level and have not gave 1 cent for years. When the NRA takes Lapierre to court for malfeasance and\r\n sues him and his cronies for stolen funds and gets rid of the crooked boards members than i might consider contributing again. In case your wondering im not a democrat or a republican. to flourish this organization needs to be apolitical. W. Glover</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n"

You saw what happened\r\n with much more powerful board members like Col. North.&nbsp; In the early days leadership kept the board in the dark like a mushroom and fed us very little information, or lies.&nbsp; Old leadership assured us everything was fine and we had little hard materials at\r\n the time to question them. &nbsp;In addition, our attorney said we could not speak out during the court case, that was bullshit advice too. &nbsp;Once some of us got access to factual information, mainly from the court proceedings, we could rise up and educate other\r\n board members while still being told everything is fine.&nbsp; They fed us all bullshit.&nbsp; Since I was out spoken and elected 1<sup>st</sup> VP I was hauled in by the NY AG for depositions and then last fall in front of the judge for over two hours.\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif; color: #1f497d;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif; color: #1f497d;\">Last year I was prepared to resign if not elected 1<sup>st</sup> Vice President, you can only beat your head against the wall for so long.&nbsp; There needed\r\n to be significant change in leadership, but the old leadership controlled everything.&nbsp; Initially there was two of us, then 6, then 11, then 16 board member Patriots that worked tirelessly to get a new leadership team elected so we could enact the much needed\r\n change. &nbsp;It was never my intent to run for leadership, but near the elections it became apparent we needed businessman leadership and ran.&nbsp; Our team of candidates ran against all the odds against leadership change.&nbsp; After winning, we were told for the first\r\n time in 153 years new leadership was elected from the floor and not from the Nominating Committee’s recommendations which the old leadership team controlled.&nbsp; Unfortunately last year our president candidate lost by a few votes, but myself, the 2<sup>nd</sup>\r\n Vice President and the EVP were elected by very slim margins.&nbsp; That president and the Cabal were diametrically opposed to the Vice Presidents so we steam rolled over the president and the remnants of the old leaders to start exposing what was going on and\r\n making changes for the good of the members.&nbsp; The new EVP was extremely supportive.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif; color: #1f497d;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif; color: #1f497d;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif; color: #1f497d;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif; color: #333333;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; One example:&nbsp; Many of us believe the Board of Directors is out of control.&nbsp; The biggest companies in the world have about a dozen.&nbsp; 76 directors is absurd.&nbsp; Just a couple\r\n of magazine issues ago, there was a lengthy article justifying this ridiculous number.&nbsp; Wrong answer.&nbsp; If the NRA's response to legitimate member complaints are to explain them away, and continue on with business as normal, you are doomed. All the articles\r\n in the world won't make up for inaction.&nbsp; The time is now to get it done.&nbsp; You have a lot of convincing to do.\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt;

There is now zero tolerance going forward for any malfeasance, shenanigans, self-dealing, &nbsp;etc. &nbsp;The Officers and Board members are unpaid, volunteer positions.&nbsp; I put in over 70 hours per week, plus evenings out\r\n and lots of travel.&nbsp; While as a board member, NRA never paid for any of my travel costs, meals, etc., I paid for them out of my own pocket.&nbsp; Even now with significant travel, I still pay my own way, as do the other Officers.&nbsp;\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt;

However, I would love to write to our other president.</div>\r\n<div>In the meantime, I will write to you hopefully with an adequate answer.</div>\r\n<div>I have been a NRA member since 1965, fresh out of our USN with an honorable discharge, of course. I didn't have a huge sum of money, so I took a menial&nbsp;job to make ends meet, providing a place to live supporting my wife and young daughter.Wages in 1965\r\n were not the greatest but&nbsp;I managed. Ok, enough&nbsp;of that personal stuff. I don't believe&nbsp;you want to read my life story.</div>\r\n<div>Since I knew&nbsp;about engines, A/C type and autos, I took a job in what we called a filling station.</div>\r\n<div>One of my customers was a CMDR, USN, a mustang!&nbsp; Getting&nbsp;to the crux of your inquiry,\r\n<b>w</b></div>\r\n<div><b>Why I joined the NRA</b>, a friend of mine, a fellow enthusiast rifle owner, suggested that I join the NRA.WHY? I asked. so without&nbsp;getting on a pulpit and start pontificating about all the attributes of joining, I said, Ok, how&nbsp; much? Damn! I said.\r\n I am only making $50 dollars a week! It would be a third of my take home. After some contemplation I forked over the amount necessary. Whoa Nelly! Not so easy. First I had to fill out the application, etc,etc,etc.At the bottom of the app, it was asked that\r\n I have a police officer or a military officer vouch for my veracity&nbsp;of my prior military service...criminal record, etc.I passed on all accounts. CMDR John(his last name is not coming to mind). I had to drop my membership for a couple of years, but rejoined,\r\n becoming a LIFER a number of years later.Speeding up my anthology, Around 1985, I went to a gun show at the Pomona Fairgrounds,California. There was a line of tables just prior&nbsp;to the gate entry. Hey, one guy yelled out, &quot;you want to save $10 on your entry\r\n fee? Yeah. How? Join the NRA and we will give you a discount.Huh? (No vexing, vetting the 'potentially' new member was&nbsp; administered) Nope. Just pay the fee and you're in! After some mental thinking about that, I said to my friend, How do they know that particular\r\n person they are trying to encourage...bribe, a person to join the NRA for a discount, and they don't even&nbsp; know who or what he is, or what he is? My words to him where; F......g BS! I had to have&nbsp;a P.O or military officer vouch for me and here they are hawking\r\n NRA memberships, just to join and get their quota up. This I didn't like. I got over it, but it took me a while. Like with President Trump, I have not been a happy&nbsp; camper with the NRA and the path they went down. It's akin to a marriage of which I have been\r\n addicted to for sixty-two years.</div>\r\n<div>I beat my jowls long enough for you to yawn in boredom. I had to get&nbsp;that off my chest. It's been a burr under my saddle for years. One last thing. I read an article in a magazine that was very opinionated. (see attached). The shooter friend that showed\r\n me this article, I bounced back at him...and others standing near at our rifle match, had it not been for the NRA, and similar organizations, but namely the NRA, we'd been screwed a long time ago! &quot;Had it not been for the NRA ILA, going to court to challenge\r\n different anit-gun bills, where would we be today I asked'? I begged my fellow shooters to give me an answer.Nothing. Like my marriage, the NRA isn't perfect. Like any faceted organizations, NRA has been at the fore-front., has been spurious to some people...as\r\n the writer in the article suggests. Well, sorry for him...for&nbsp;his loss!.</div>\r\n<div>;I miss Charlie Askins;.Bart Skelton; as well as his father, some I can't name just now,&nbsp; and all the contributing articles of yore to name a few.&nbsp; Just a suggestion&nbsp;for the NRA to re-incorporate.</div>\r\n<div>There you have it, Mr. President, my. ad nauseam ear bender. I have more but this will do for now. Feel free to write anytime.</div>\r\n<div>Respectfully,&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>Joseph A.Bonk</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n"

When I was a child we had firearms all over the house (mostly antiques or odd caliber military firearms with no ammunition).&nbsp; We were taught gun safety and not to play with them.&nbsp; We never\r\n thought about anyone stealing them.&nbsp; Even when we moved to Fort Wayne in 1963, we had a glass door gun cabinet in our living room in front of a big picture window and never worried about theft.&nbsp; Now, I have my firearms locked in a safe where I rarely see them.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div style=\"line-height: 1.284;

As of May Fort Wayne has had 13 homicides.&nbsp; In the last few weeks there have been several incidents involving children 14 – 18 years old.&nbsp; Fort Wayne has also had multiple shootings by police officers.&nbsp; My personal\r\n feeling is that the increased violence in television and movies over the last several decades has convinced people that killing is a routine way to solve problems.&nbsp; &nbsp; Changing that culture will be challenging.&nbsp; The recent juvenile incidents in Fort Wayne have\r\n stimulated action from the mayor, law enforcement and civic groups.&nbsp; In addition to increasing promotion of gun safety and competition (particularly for children) the NRA might explore collaboration with appropriate social and/or psychological experts and/or\r\n organizations to support and/or develop programs to modify attitudes and/or provide resources to neighborhoods to reduce the use of violence to solve problems.&nbsp; One possibility might be collaboration with Big Brothers Big Sisters.&nbsp; That would likely be a very\r\n challenging process.&nbsp; Firearms safety, hunter safety and air rifle programs might be possibilities.&nbsp; Any attempt to work with Big Brothers Big Sisters should be led by an NRA member who is active in Big Sisters Big Sisters.</div>\r\n<div style=\"line-height: 1.284; margin: 0in; font-family: Aptos, Aptos_EmbeddedFont, Aptos_MSFontService, Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif;

It is far overdue for law abiding gun owners to finally have Reciprocity like so many Presidents have promised us and never granted, including President Trump. So, when you meet with him, I suggest you advise him to go\r\n in front of Congress televised and shame the Democrats who always block it. He should remind them that they can go anywhere in our Country with armed security paid with our TAXES but refuse to give us that same right. Then he should shame them by asking them\r\n if they think their lives are more important than ours, which they certainly are not!</div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\" data-setdir=\"false\">No2. I became an NRA pistol instructor in the early 2000's. I taught many students and enjoyed doing it until higher ups decided to change the way we teach. Getting the student packed with the certificate included was the\r\n way it should have stayed, but no, now greed stepped in, and I must pay you $60 per student and figure out how to teach online. How is a student supposed to ask a computer course question's when I used to answer all of them myself? So paying the $60 and paying\r\n for the student packed doesn't leave much room for what I used to charge and has taken the fun out of teaching. I know numerous instructors who refuse to even bother teaching anymore because of that change. That amounts to less people getting permits and less\r\n students joining our NRA. and less people voting with against the anti-2nd Amendment crowd. I would suggest that you change it back to the old way. I hope what I've just relayed to you helps in the future!</div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\" data-setdir=\"false\">Respectfully,</div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\" data-setdir=\"false\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Charles L.

I am unhappy with the abandonment of Camp Atterbury for these events and scattering them all over the country. I and&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\" data-setdir=\"false\">many other shooters liked the ability to come to one venue and shoot 3 different championships. With the scattered locations that exist now that is impossible. Ive heard that these matches</div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\" data-setdir=\"false\">were money losers and I can appreciate that, however the NRA has done very little promotion escpecially in the American Rifleman. I noticed in this last issue there was a nice&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\" data-setdir=\"false\">article promoting the World Shooting Championship at Camp Atterbury. I appreciate promoting this event I ;only wish my type of events had been promoted in the past. I also know&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\" data-setdir=\"false\">some financial decisions were made last year that probably put the NRA in the hole moneywise. I think this could be fixed and certainly hope you would support that in the</div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\" data-setdir=\"false\">Future. Please give this some consideration. I would welcome further discussion if you would want to do that</div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\" data-setdir=\"false\">Respectfully</div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\" data-setdir=\"false\">John Powers</div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\" data-setdir=\"false\">#8456079</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n"

The check has been processed through our bank and the funds have been received by the NRA.\r\n \r\nWe hope this fulfills all issues related to the shipment of this jacket.\r\n \r\nThanking you in advance,\r\n \r\nAnthony and Carolyn Kaufman\r\n321-414-2796\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Kaufman,\r\n \r\nMy name is Devin, and I’m the NRA Member Services Manager. Our EVP/CEO Doug Hamlin tasked me with looking into the situation described in your letter.\r\n \r\nWe don’t have a record of a call on January 14th. However, we did later receive an offer reply from you in the mail, which I’ve attached in this email, authorizing a $250 contribution and selecting the 1871 Jacket in size Large as a gift. When attempting to process that, the Discover card you provided was declined. This resulted in an open invoice being created, with the jacket on hold awaiting a valid payment. This is what led to the letters you later received thanking you for your pledge and asking for payment information.\r\n \r\nI was able to listen to a recording of the call made on March 10th, and the reason our representative could not find the order is because she was only looking at Carolyn’s membership file, while the order is under Anthony’s. I understand the confusion and frustration that would come from that, and I do apologize.\r\n \r\nAs far as the jacket, it is still on hold for you. We will just need a valid payment for the pledged $250 contribution. To do this, you can call 800-672-3888 and provide Anthony’s membership number, 19759113. That way, the representative will immediately see the open invoice and be able to apply the payment to it, which will then trigger the jacket being shipped to you. Please feel free to reply to this email if you have any additional questions or concerns.\r\n \r\nThank you,\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDevin Cate\r\nManager, Member Services\r\n Membership Division\r\nT (703) 397-3897\r\nE [ dcate@nrahq.org ]( mailto:dcate@nrahq.org )\r\n \r\n\r\nNational Rifle Association | 11250 Waples Mill Rd, Fairfax, VA 22030\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n "

I read\r\n and appreciate your letter to us in the August 2025 edition. It was a welcome sight and one that was long past due.</span><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Arial Rounded MT Bold&quot;,sans-serif\"><o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:10.0pt;line-height:115%\"><span style=\"font-size:13.5pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;color:#46474A;background:#F8F8F8\">I had become discouraged about the state of the NRA over the past several\r\n years. I was never ashamed of being an NRA member but I was not proud, either. I know so many of us were disillusioned about our present and future that I felt that the end of the NRA was close. I was so happy to see the shakeup that recently happened and\r\n the new direction that seems to have been committed to. If our forward movement continues, as you outlined, we can then become an organization that we are proud of, and support, rather than hide from and keep to ourselves.</span><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Arial Rounded MT Bold&quot;,sans-serif\"><o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:10.0pt;line-height:115%\"><span style=\"font-size:13.5pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;color:#46474A;background:#F8F8F8\">Since you said that you have our ears, I wish to ramble on about many things\r\n that I would like to see changed. I am not speaking for only myself, but for many I have spoken with over the years. What I am writing is a voice of many, not just one. I hope you receive it with the intent given and not as a slam against a great organization.\r\n I am writing this from the front lone, not the ivory towers or the elite. I am speaking for the blue-collar members and non-members who are hesitant to join. Hopefully we get your ears.</span><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Arial Rounded MT Bold&quot;,sans-serif\"><o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:10.0pt;line-height:115%\"><span style=\"font-size:13.5pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;color:#46474A;background:#F8F8F8\">#1 is that we need to get back to, and to be known for, what made us great\r\n to start with. The basics: educating our youths about safe gun handling as well as learning how to shoot responsibly. Training camps, shooting contests, proper storage and keeping our guns clean and functional. The basics that every person who holds a gun\r\n should know by heart.</span><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Arial Rounded MT Bold&quot;,sans-serif\"><o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:10.0pt;line-height:115%\"><span style=\"font-size:13.5pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;color:#46474A;background:#F8F8F8\">How? By offering free seminars and camps. Free because so many of us cannot\r\n afford the $100 entry and another $100 for ammo and another for gas to get there and another $100 for accommodations and meals, etc. I know I would gladly contribute to specified outings because I knew where my money was going. Donating before meant we had\r\n no idea how much went to support events and how much went to chartered flights private jets, thousand dollars steaks, etc. I stopped giving when I didn’t know where the money went. If 10% of what I donated went to a cause, that didn’t work for me. If 90% goes\r\n to training our kids, count me in.</span><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Arial Rounded MT Bold&quot;,sans-serif\"><o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:10.0pt;line-height:115%\"><span style=\"font-size:13.5pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;color:#46474A;background:#F8F8F8\">#2. STOP WITH THE SPAM, AGGRESSIVE AND ANNOYING TELEMARKETING! I mean it.\r\n Every number I got from the NRA on my incoming calls has been blocked. I don’t want to hear it. I won’t answer it and I blocked every number. Telemarketing is so low on the slimy list that it has ruined our reputation to everybody. Just stop it!</span><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Arial Rounded MT Bold&quot;,sans-serif\"><o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:10.0pt;line-height:115%\"><span style=\"font-size:13.5pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;color:#46474A;background:#F8F8F8\">#3 STOP WITH THE CHICKEN LITTLE, END OF THE WORLD direct mailings. Just stop\r\n wasting money. If you know what Chicken Little means then you know that crying the end of the world long enough, no one listens any more. These horrible letters got old decades ago yet they still come! Yes, every administration wants to take our guns. We know\r\n that! But to send letter after letter telling us this is the worst it’s ever been and you need our money TODAY to fight it has become the joke of direct mail. The NRA has become a laughing stock! I never open ANY mail from the NRA because it’s full of nonsense\r\n and drama. Every mailing costs, what $5 million dollars? Any NRA mail I get is shredded immediately, never opened. I am tired of the begging and nonsense. Enough is enough and the NRA crossed that line a long time ago.\r\n</span><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Arial Rounded MT Bold&quot;,sans-serif\"><o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:10.0pt;line-height:115%\"><span style=\"font-size:13.5pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;color:#46474A;background:#F8F8F8\">#4 I DON’T WANT TO REGISTER FOR A FREE TRUCK OR ENDANGERED RIFLE OR ANOTHER\r\n KNIFE OR DUFFEL BAG IF I DONATE! Enough! Goes straight to the garbage! What am I donating to? The general fund? How much of my donation actually goes to something worthwhile? 25%? 10%? 50%? How much? Is the NRA a bureaucracy or an organization that truly help\r\n it’s members or executives?</span><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Arial Rounded MT Bold&quot;,sans-serif\"><o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:10.0pt;line-height:115%\"><span style=\"font-size:13.5pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;color:#46474A;background:#F8F8F8\">I know this has become redundant but the message is the same. The NRA used\r\n to be about begging for money every email, direct mail, phone call and message. Yes, the NRA does need money for it’s mission. No doubt. Your August 2025 letter to stated that you’re becoming transparent. If that is true and you earn back our trust, then the\r\n money will begin to roll in. We have money to donate. We want to donate but we want to know what we are donating to. Dinners or causes? Private jets or gun rights? What? Tell us. We’ll listen.</span><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Arial Rounded MT Bold&quot;,sans-serif\"><o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:10.0pt;line-height:115%\"><span style=\"font-size:13.5pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;color:#46474A;background:#F8F8F8\">Yes, I’ve mentioned a few things that annoy me to no end. You’ve mentioned\r\n that you know we are fed up and want change and that you are heading in that direction. If true, we will rise again. If your present marketing continues with it’s horrible and outdated methods, then we will cease to exist. You need to find a MUCH BETTER way\r\n to market the NRA to the general public.</span><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Arial Rounded MT Bold&quot;,sans-serif\"><o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:10.0pt;line-height:115%\"><span style=\"font-size:13.5pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;color:#46474A;background:#F8F8F8\">I’ve complained but I have some answers as well.

How is that possible? The NRA is THE grassroots organization for America yet such a small percentage have joined? I assume it’s because of the terrible reputation that was earned during these last 20 years\r\n when we needed the support the most yet the NRA became the tackiest it’s even been. The NRA was also the strongest it needed to be to go against Obama and the anti-gun lobby. The NRA was so strong yet lost so much credibility during these times.

Have this website generate an email to the member thanking them for the purchase and offering (something) for\r\n their renewal.</span><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Arial Rounded MT Bold&quot;,sans-serif\"><o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"gmail-msolistparagraph\" style=\"mso-margin-top-alt:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.5in;line-height:115%\">\r\n<span style=\"font-size:13.5pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;color:#46474A\">B)</span><span style=\"font-size:13.5pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;color:#46474A\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13.5pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;color:#46474A;background:#F8F8F8\">If the buyer says “no”, complete the transaction as usual but tell them that the NRA will send them a free 1-year membership, at no cost\r\n with no credit card number, etc. The store then enters the buyers name, address, email, phone, etc into the NRA website. Each time the gun shop enters a “new” member, he gets XX points that can be used towards XX gifts, plaques, t-shirts or whatever, e.g.\r\n each “new” NRA logged in gets the shop 100 points. At 1000 points they can get a t-shirt or 5000 points gets an NRA knife, etc. The stuff the NRA gives now while begging to donations. With this free membership, the NRA can send a welcome letter that is classy\r\n and explains our mission. No slime. No begging for money, just a warm welcome. Also, send them a free Rifleman subscription. This is one of the best magazines of any kind out there. It is a real gem. Get it in their hands. Send them the link for the online\r\n magazine as well. Let them see what we do without pushy marketing. Don’t spam emails. Don’t ever call. Just let them absorb who we are and what we do.&nbsp; After 10 months, ask them what they think. If we convert 10%, we did good. Very good.\r\n</span><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Arial Rounded MT Bold&quot;,sans-serif\"><o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"gmail-msolistparagraph\" style=\"mso-margin-top-alt:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.5in;line-height:115%\">\r\n<span style=\"font-size:13.5pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;color:#46474A;background:#F8F8F8\">&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Arial Rounded MT Bold&quot;,sans-serif\"><o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"gmail-msolistparagraph\" style=\"mso-margin-top-alt:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.5in;line-height:115%\">\r\n<span style=\"font-size:13.5pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;color:#46474A;background:#F8F8F8\">We need 50 million members, not 5 million.

Tell me where my money is going and I may donate.

I read and appreciate your letter to us in the August 2025 edition.\r\n It was a welcome sight and one that was long past due.</font></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 10pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial Rounded MT Bold&quot;,sans-serif\">\r\n<span style=\"line-height:115%;font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;color:rgb(70,71,74);background:rgb(248,248,248)\"><font size=\"4\">I had become discouraged about the state of the NRA over the past several years. I was never ashamed of being an NRA member but I\r\n was not proud, either. I know so many of us were disillusioned about our present and future that I felt that the end of the NRA was close. I was so happy to see the shakeup that recently happened and the new direction that seems to have been committed to.\r\n If our forward movement continues, as you outlined, we can then become an organization that we are proud of, and support, rather than hide from and keep to ourselves.</font></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 10pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial Rounded MT Bold&quot;,sans-serif\">\r\n<span style=\"line-height:115%;font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;color:rgb(70,71,74);background:rgb(248,248,248)\"><font size=\"4\">Since you said that you have our ears, I wish to ramble on about many things that I would like to see changed. I am not speaking for\r\n only myself, but for many I have spoken with over the years. What I am writing is a voice of many, not just one. I hope you receive it with the intent given and not as a slam against a great organization. I am writing this from the front lone, not the ivory\r\n towers or the elite. I am speaking for the blue-collar members and non-members who are hesitant to join. Hopefully we get your ears.</font></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 10pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial Rounded MT Bold&quot;,sans-serif\">\r\n<span style=\"line-height:115%;font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;color:rgb(70,71,74);background:rgb(248,248,248)\"><font size=\"4\">#1 is that we need to get back to, and to be known for, what made us great to start with. The basics: educating our youths about safe\r\n gun handling as well as learning how to shoot responsibly. Training camps, shooting contests, proper storage and keeping our guns clean and functional. The basics that every person who holds a gun should know by heart.</font></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 10pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial Rounded MT Bold&quot;,sans-serif\">\r\n<span style=\"line-height:115%;font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;color:rgb(70,71,74);background:rgb(248,248,248)\"><font size=\"4\">How? By offering free seminars and camps. Free because so many of us cannot afford the $100 entry and another $100 for ammo and another\r\n for gas to get there and another $100 for accommodations and meals, etc. I know I would gladly contribute to specified outings because I knew where my money was going. Donating before meant we had no idea how much went to support events and how much went to\r\n chartered flights private jets, thousand dollars steaks, etc. I stopped giving when I didn’t know where the money went. If 10% of what I donated went to a cause, that didn’t work for me. If 90% goes to training our kids, count me in.</font></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 10pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial Rounded MT Bold&quot;,sans-serif\">\r\n<span style=\"line-height:115%;font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;color:rgb(70,71,74);background:rgb(248,248,248)\"><font size=\"4\">#2. STOP WITH THE SPAM, AGGRESSIVE AND ANNOYING TELEMARKETING! I mean it. Every number I got from the NRA on my incoming calls has\r\n been blocked. I don’t want to hear it. I won’t answer it and I blocked every number. Telemarketing is so low on the slimy list that it has ruined our reputation to everybody. Just stop it!</font></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 10pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial Rounded MT Bold&quot;,sans-serif\">\r\n<span style=\"line-height:115%;font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;color:rgb(70,71,74);background:rgb(248,248,248)\"><font size=\"4\">#3 STOP WITH THE CHICKEN LITTLE, END OF THE WORLD direct mailings. Just stop wasting money. If you know what Chicken Little means\r\n then you know that crying the end of the world long enough, no one listens any more. These horrible letters got old decades ago yet they still come! Yes, every administration wants to take our guns. We know that! But to send letter after letter telling us\r\n this is the worst it’s ever been and you need our money TODAY to fight it has become the joke of direct mail. The NRA has become a laughing stock! I never open ANY mail from the NRA because it’s full of nonsense and drama. Every mailing costs, what $5 million\r\n dollars? Any NRA mail I get is shredded immediately, never opened. I am tired of the begging and nonsense. Enough is enough and the NRA crossed that line a long time ago.\r\n</font></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 10pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial Rounded MT Bold&quot;,sans-serif\">\r\n<span style=\"line-height:115%;font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;color:rgb(70,71,74);background:rgb(248,248,248)\"><font size=\"4\">#4 I DON’T WANT TO REGISTER FOR A FREE TRUCK OR ENDANGERED RIFLE OR ANOTHER KNIFE OR DUFFEL BAG IF I DONATE! Enough! Goes straight\r\n to the garbage! What am I donating to? The general fund? How much of my donation actually goes to something worthwhile? 25%? 10%? 50%? How much? Is the NRA a bureaucracy or an organization that truly help it’s members or executives?</font></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 10pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial Rounded MT Bold&quot;,sans-serif\">\r\n<span style=\"line-height:115%;font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;color:rgb(70,71,74);background:rgb(248,248,248)\"><font size=\"4\">I know this has become redundant but the message is the same. The NRA used to be about begging for money every email, direct mail,\r\n phone call and message. Yes, the NRA does need money for it’s mission. No doubt. Your August 2025 letter to stated that you’re becoming transparent. If that is true and you earn back our trust, then the money will begin to roll in. We have money to donate.\r\n We want to donate but we want to know what we are donating to. Dinners or causes? Private jets or gun rights? What? Tell us. We’ll listen.</font></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 10pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial Rounded MT Bold&quot;,sans-serif\">\r\n<span style=\"line-height:115%;font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;color:rgb(70,71,74);background:rgb(248,248,248)\"><font size=\"4\">Yes, I’ve mentioned a few things that annoy me to no end. You’ve mentioned that you know we are fed up and want change and that you\r\n are heading in that direction. If true, we will rise again. If your present marketing continues with it’s horrible and outdated methods, then we will cease to exist. You need to find a MUCH BETTER way to market the NRA to the general public.</font></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 10pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial Rounded MT Bold&quot;,sans-serif\">\r\n<span style=\"line-height:115%;font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;color:rgb(70,71,74);background:rgb(248,248,248)\"><font size=\"4\">I’ve complained but I have some answers as well. No use complaining without some solutions. That’s not right.</font></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 10pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial Rounded MT Bold&quot;,sans-serif\">\r\n<span style=\"line-height:115%;font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;color:rgb(70,71,74);background:rgb(248,248,248)\"><font size=\"4\">First, ask yourself this: If an estimated 150 million households have a gun in their home, how many homes know the 4 rules of safety?\r\n Safe storage? Actually how to safely aim and shoot? How may are NRA members? </font>\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 10pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial Rounded MT Bold&quot;,sans-serif\">\r\n<span style=\"line-height:115%;font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;color:rgb(70,71,74);background:rgb(248,248,248)\"><font size=\"4\">How can such an important organization, a true American icon, have such a small percentage of American households as members? How\r\n is that possible? The NRA is THE grassroots organization for America yet such a small percentage have joined? I assume it’s because of the terrible reputation that was earned during these last 20 years when we needed the support the most yet the NRA became\r\n the tackiest it’s even been. The NRA was also the strongest it needed to be to go against Obama and the anti-gun lobby. The NRA was so strong yet lost so much credibility during these times. How can this be?</font></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 10pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial Rounded MT Bold&quot;,sans-serif\">\r\n<span style=\"line-height:115%;font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;color:rgb(70,71,74);background:rgb(248,248,248)\"><font size=\"4\">We need to get an immediate increase in our membership so the newest members can see how good we are, not how tacky we are.

Each time the gun shop enters a “new” member, he gets XX points that can be used towards XX gifts, plaques, t-shirts or whatever,\r\n e.g. each “new” NRA logged in gets the shop 100 points. At 1000 points they can get a t-shirt or 5000 points gets an NRA knife, etc. The stuff the NRA gives now while begging to donations. With this free membership, the NRA can send a welcome letter that is\r\n classy and explains our mission. No slime. No begging for money, just a warm welcome. Also, send them a free Rifleman subscription. This is one of the best magazines of any kind out there. It is a real gem. Get it in their hands. Send them the link for the\r\n online magazine as well. Let them see what we do without pushy marketing. Don’t spam emails. Don’t ever call. Just let them absorb who we are and what we do.&nbsp; After 10 months, ask them what they think.

Thank you for that.  I realize that I am just a lowly regular (lifetime) member, but I have a simple suggestion that I believe should be considered by the powers that be.\r\n\r\nJust think about the words NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION for a moment.  To the vast number of uninformed citizens out there who wouldn’t know a muzzle from a trigger guard (especially those on the left), it sort of sounds like a deadly projectile is about to come out of a device to destroy something.  Why not, instead, consider a less threatening name, for example NATIONAL FIREARMS SAFETY ASSOCIATION?  I can’t help but think that this might mitigate antagonism to the organization, as well as recognizing that handguns, too, are a significant part of interest to members.\r\n\r\nWell, as we often say in the aviation community……that’s my $0.02\r\n\r\nWayne Wagner \r\n465 Island Pointe Lane\r\nMoneta, VA 24121\r\n\r\n(512) 968-7312\r\nCorawaynew@gmail.com\r\nSent from my iPad"

It makes me\r\n think that no one wins and the NRA just keeps the money without any giving prizes to anyone. Perhaps the NRA could start publishing the names of members who actually win something to be more transparent. Just my two cents worth.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div dir=\"auto\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<div dir=\"auto\">I look forward to seeing how the new leadership of the NRA goes forward in the future.

My original membership was a coveted reward I received from my father who gave it to me upon my completion of the NRA Safety course which was required for me to get my hunting license\r\n (in California, how times have changed).&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\" data-setdir=\"false\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\" data-setdir=\"false\">I appreciate your asking this question and giving an email address that allows members to contact you with ideas and concerns.&nbsp; My first suggestion is that the New NRA Leadership become more accessible to its membership.&nbsp;\r\n Having an email available is a good first step in doing this and I commend you for thinking of this.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\" data-setdir=\"false\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\" data-setdir=\"false\">My concerns with the NRA run deep.&nbsp; At one time I was very active in donating and supporting the NRA but as time wore on I felt disconnected from the organization. A few trips to the annual conventions would renew my energy\r\n but after a while it seemed the organization had strayed away from the fundamental charter they had represented so well when I was younger. I am encouraged by what I read from Doug Hamlin's column regarding recommitting to education and shooting sports as\r\n this was what attracted me to the NRA in the first place.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\" data-setdir=\"false\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\" data-setdir=\"false\">With that said here is where I am really concerned as it seems the New leadership is really failing when it comes to communicating and marketing to its members and beyond.&nbsp; Being an old man (70 years old) I know the future\r\n of our rights and the great traditions of shooting sports and hunting must be carried on by a much younger generation than myself. I see so little of anything coming out of the New Leadership to connect with the younger generation it scares me.&nbsp; Organizations\r\n like GOA have actively been producing simple yet effective content on You Tube that reaches the younger generation (our future) while the NRA has nothing on this platform or any other platform I can find. When I was young most things relating to guns was hunting\r\n and cowboy style shooting.&nbsp; Today's youth seem to be more interested in the environment and shooting competitions.&nbsp; Regardless of their interest this is a golden opportunity for the NRA to once again be the premiere gun rights and education organization it\r\n once was. Although I don't understand social media too well my son and my grandkids do and I can tell you it is this method that stimulates them more than magazines.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\" data-setdir=\"false\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\" data-setdir=\"false\">To this day I look forward to receiving my American Hunter magazine in the mail each month.&nbsp; When I was young my father would get American Rifleman and I would get American Hunter.&nbsp; I'd wear the pages out reading both of them\r\n as the content was exciting and nurtured my interest further.&nbsp; This was foundational to developing my interest in gun rights as I got older.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\" data-setdir=\"false\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\" data-setdir=\"false\">Just imagine an NRA You Tube channel (to start, Tik Tok, X and other platforms too) with content educating youth on how hunting is really a conservation tool that is necessary for the well being of our environment.&nbsp; Or fun\r\n videos for the very young that have themes that will help develop a youths interest in sport of hunting or target practice. (Maybe update Eddie Eagle?).&nbsp; Or....A You Tube channel to inform members and the masses of NRA programs, victories and other news to\r\n keep us informed and possibly attract new members.&nbsp; Just yesterday there was a big ruling from the 9th Circuit Court that rejected California's ammunition registration scheme.&nbsp; &nbsp;One of the independent You Tube activist mentioned this appeal was funded and\r\n supported by the NRA.&nbsp; I would have never known that if I wasn't a member as I would likely have found out months later in the magazine.</div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\" data-setdir=\"false\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\" data-setdir=\"false\">I could go on and on and I apologize for the lengthy email but I really feel strongly that if the NRA is going to become the premiere civil rights organization again it needs to do something fast.&nbsp; As a former executive at\r\n Mattel I saw first hand what can be done to revive an old brand and make it better than it ever was before just by connecting with potential customers (Barbie).&nbsp; She was dead in the water and was written off by the &quot;critics and experts&quot; saying she couldn't\r\n be relevant because little girls today don't play with dolls.&nbsp; Were they wrong.&nbsp; &nbsp;Although the NRA is not quite dead in the water we too can become relevant and better than ever.&nbsp; I hope these suggestion help stimulate some ideas.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\" data-setdir=\"false\">Thank you for your time.</div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\" data-setdir=\"false\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\" data-setdir=\"false\">Frank Maranto</div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\" data-setdir=\"false\">000038850905</div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\" data-setdir=\"false\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\" data-setdir=\"false\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\" data-setdir=\"false\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n"

I \r\nmade contributions to the NRA-ILA\r\n\r\nas I was financially able and was awarded several certificates of \r\nappreciation. Over the years the NRA offered discounts on membership \r\nupgrades on special occasions and in\r\n\r\n1996 I upgraded to Patriot Member and to Benefactor Member in January \r\n2000. I received an autographed photo of Charlton Heston somewhere along \r\nthe way and a Millennium\r\n\r\nHonor Roll certificate in November 2000 also signed by Charlton Heston. \r\nI joined the Golden Eagles starting in June 2016 and continued for \r\nseveral years.\r\n\r\n     I have attended several Annual Meetings when they were East of the \r\nMississippi. I attended the Annual Meeting in Cincinnati with my \r\nfather-in-law when the crap hit the fan due\r\n\r\n  to Neal Knox and his efforts. I had no idea what the issue was at the \r\ntime. I was also at the Indianapolis Annual Meeting when the last crisis \r\nhappened and again had no idea what the issue was.\r\n\r\nAs that crisis slowly became known, I kept the faith for some time \r\nbecause I certainly did not believe any information coming from the New \r\nYork legal department and others who were attacking\r\n\r\nthe NRA until it became obvious that there were serious problems in the \r\nNRA leadership. Then the Biden administration took their shot at the US \r\neconomy and everything else necessary for freedom.\r\n\r\nI passed the age of 80 as Biden took office and finances became a more \r\nserious concern. I reluctantly have not kept up my Golden Eagle dues \r\ncommitment in recent years and I am not proud of that.\r\n\r\nI hope to again honor that commitment as the economy improves under the \r\nTrump administration.\r\n\r\n     I am encouraged in recent months by what I am reading in the \r\nAmerican Rifleman and in the emails received from the current NRA \r\nleadership that our ship appears to be turning around.\r\n\r\nI realize that this may not happen as quickly as we would like and the \r\nmain stream media will certainly be reluctant to report anything \r\npositive concerning the NRA. I am a firm believer in prayer.\r\n\r\nKeep up the good work.\r\n\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\n\r\nBob Willman\r\nThe Eagle's Anvil\r\nBowling Green, Ohio\r\nWB8NQW\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is much easier at all times to prevent an evil than to rectify mistakes.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge Washington\r\n\r\n"

I have gifted many life memberships over the years, been an attendee in several Annual Meetings, but find myself with little interest in the NRA given my unhappiness with how the scandal has been handled.  I wrote to the Board shortly after the story broke and asked for clarification, but heard nothing.  What I know now is what I have gleaned from the local media [valueless] and what I’ve read in the American Rifleman [incomplete to say the least].\r\n\r\nWhat I need is an explanation of what was alleged the NRA did wrong, what the NRA’s response was, what the NRA admitted was done and what the judge finally ruled as the “settlement” in the case.  Why do I want this information?  I used to be a police officer, and most of my life was spent as an expert witness involving fires.  As such, I appreciate the legal system, even if the NY legal system is as corrupt as one can be.  I also know that what is alleged, admitted to, and ultimately adjudicated can change dramatically as the legal system works through the matter.\r\n\r\nThere were several accounts given, which told of significant “crimes” committed by the NRA officials, primarily by the media and ex-board members.  I’d like to know what happened.  Until I do, my regard for the NRA, and my defense of the NRA to my friends, will lack the moral high ground I need to make my case.\r\n\r\nI joined the NRA in the 1970’s [member # 2949008] as a police officer because I could see the deterioration of the American culture and recognized the value of a strong Second Amendment.  Please give me the reason to be proud of my membership and once again defend the NRA to the naysayers.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nDan Churchward\r\n daniellchurchward@gmail.com\r\n260.449.0077\r\n\r\n"

          "body": "Dear Mr. Bachenberg,\r\n\r\n     I was taken by surprise with your candid acknowledgement of mismanagement and promises unfulfilled - which had not escaped my critical notice for nearly ten years - in your August 2025 President’s Column. \r\n     I was trained by an NRA Instructor in 1963 at a young age while at Camp. I became a Life Member in 2014 (000206168419) who stepped up to Endowment once, but received no incentive promised - even after phone contact. I turned off the tap and deflected any further NRA requests for financial assistance. I couldn’t help but notice an increase in lavish lifestyle by the Board.\r\n     My hope for trust and confidence is renewed after reading your pledge, changes, and commitment. Because of these assurances, I am re-establishing donations to the NRA.\r\n     Good luck, and I accept this opportunity to reconnect.\r\n\r\n                                   Dave Smith\r\n                                   Ormond Beach, FL"

Member are looking for action and results to match the words.\r\n\r\nI don’t know who is left from the old regime but we need a clean slate with integrity that’s beyond reproach in every aspect.  \r\n\r\nWe need scales back pay packages, benefits and perks to restore financial stability and integrity.  No stone should be left unturned.  Fully accountable starts with reported and transparency  regarding those perks and Packages.  I would like to see list of what all executives packages look like and every perk and gift reported .  \r\n\r\nItems on my list for the NRA \r\n\r\nNational carry license so when I travel I can pack without fear of transgressions. I have been vetted by NYS and posses a concealed permit, that vetting should suffice for national carry rights\r\n\r\nKeep challenging NYS restrictive carry policy.  You can’t carry in parks and many other areas while running Daily errands.  Your focus to lock up your firearm in your cars. If your car is broken into and you’re firearm stolen, you lose you’re permit and face other changes.\r\n\r\nI know of a NRA member that had home security and firearms locked in a safe.

I've never been in a BoD meeting, so I have no direct concept of &quot;how the sausage is made&quot;. But I expect that if ugly things can happen at a Board of Elders meeting at\r\n church, similar things and far worse can happen at the NRA's BoD meetings, as well! Kudos to you for being the man in the arena!<br>\r\n</div>\r\n<div><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>You asked why I joined the NRA. I tried to remember. I'm now 66 yrs old and retired. I used to quail hunt, but I don't anymore. I used to teach Hunter Education, but I don't anymore. I know the NRA was pivotal in starting Hunter Education and I believe\r\n still supports it, even though it is mostly canned on-line material, today. I can remember my first introduction to modern semi-auto handguns at a NRA pistol course many years ago. (I did this only so that I could be better able to field questions about handguns\r\n in my Hunter Ed classes.) That first time shooting a Glock 9mm sparked a love of shooting sports/disciplines that has grown into my primary hobby, today. But honestly, the NRA hasn't had a central or mentorship role in any of those things, for me. The NRA\r\n has always been peripheral, not essential. I've never been to one of the big NRA gun shows. I do enjoy reading through the magazine (used to be American Hunter, now American Rifleman) over breakfast, though. So I'd say NRA is part of the warp and woof of the\r\n entire world of shooting, but if the NRA went away into the night, the story of firearms rights and marksmanship would continue just fine.&nbsp;<br>\r\n</div>\r\n<div><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>So when the news broke of the impropriety of the NRA officers, I definitely took a &quot;wait and see&quot; attitude to see if the NRA could regain my confidence. I think I'm still waiting, in some respects, though I did re-up for another 5 yrs recently (gotta keep\r\n getting my magazines to read at breakfast!). When it comes to 2A protections, NRA is no longer the first organization that I think of. There has been some willingness to compromise and go along to get along in the NRA camp that has been a great disappointment\r\n to me. Case in point would be the red flag laws championed by Texas' own John Cornyn! I can't stand that guy! He's such a RINO! And I am very hopeful that he will get primaried out in '26! I'll be watching to see whether the NRA endorses Cornyn or a more worthy\r\n 2A champion in the '26 primary race.</div>\r\n<div class=\"zmail_signature_below\">\r\n<div id=\"\" data-zbluepencil-ignore=\"true\" data-sigid=\"8970922000000008028\">\r\n<div>\r\n<p style=\"\"><span class=\"colour\" style=\"color: rgb(42, 42, 42);\">--Mackey Morgan</span><br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div><span class=\"colour\" style=\"color: rgb(42, 42, 42);\">Sent using <a target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(89, 143, 222);\">\r\nZoho Mail</a></span><br>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div><br>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<br>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n"

This standard\r\n far exceeds that of the FBI test and nearly all state POST qualifications.&nbsp; This is the mindset of the buzzer gamers. This is reinforced by the accompanying pictures with the usual high speed gamer belt.&nbsp; Not exactly what we normies wear to Walmart.</div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\" data-setdir=\"false\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\" data-setdir=\"false\">Is this suggested standard really expected, or even a realistic goal, for civilians and the general membership?&nbsp; It ignores nearly all the data on LE and civilian shootings per DOJ and Tom Givens; that is -- 90% of all shootings\r\n at 7 yards or less. Or as Givens' states -- master the length of a pickup truck. Yes, I'm aware of the outliers like the Fairchild AFB and Indiana mall food court shootings. They are outliers, and as such are memorable. Let's also not forget that even at these\r\n closer ranges, the LE &quot;hit&quot; rate is about 20%, and hovers near 30% for larger departments (LAPD and Dallas PD) where the influence of highly specialized SWAT teams up the score.&nbsp; And it also seems unrealistic for most compact carry guns.</div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\" data-setdir=\"false\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\" data-setdir=\"false\">What really annoys me is that few gun owners train, even those that get their CCW and actually carry.&nbsp; Many of my trainers have noted that I am among the far less than 1% of gun owners that take\r\n<u>any</u> kind of formal training.&nbsp; And I have been to about 50 firearm courses (yes, I also dry fire regularly with and without lasers).&nbsp; I guess the point is the author cites a drill/standard that is far beyond what most gun owners can achieve or is really\r\n necessary; granted that most won't recognize it.&nbsp; But for those that try, failing to achieve such a suggested high standard leaves one wondering &quot;why bother to train or practice at all&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp;Better to highlight a more reasonable drill and standard for the normies,\r\n of which I am one.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\" data-setdir=\"false\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\" data-setdir=\"false\">No response is required.&nbsp; FYI only.</div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\" data-setdir=\"false\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\" data-setdir=\"false\">Steve Cooke</div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\" data-setdir=\"false\">Cheyenne, WY</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n"

You saw what happened with much\r\n more powerful board members like Col. North.&nbsp; In the early days leadership kept the board in the dark like a mushroom and fed us very little information, or lies.&nbsp; Old leadership assured us everything was fine and we had little hard materials at the time to\r\n question them.&nbsp; In addition, our attorney said we could not speak out during the court case, that was bullshit advice too.&nbsp; Once some of us got access to factual information, mainly from the court proceedings, we could rise up and educate other board members\r\n while still being told everything is fine.&nbsp; They fed us all bullshit.&nbsp; Since I was out spoken and elected 1<sup>st</sup> VP I was hauled in by the NY AG for depositions and then last fall in front of the judge for over two hours.\r\n<u></u><u></u></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;color:#1f497d\"><u></u>&nbsp;<u></u></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;color:#1f497d\">Last year I was prepared to resign if not elected 1<sup>st</sup> Vice President, you can only beat your head against the wall for so long.&nbsp; There needed to be\r\n significant change in leadership, but the old leadership controlled everything.&nbsp; Initially there was two of us, then 6, then 11, then 16 board member Patriots that worked tirelessly to get a new leadership team elected so we could enact the much needed change.\r\n &nbsp;It was never my intent to run for leadership, but near the elections it became apparent we needed businessman leadership and ran.&nbsp; Our team of candidates ran against all the odds against leadership change.&nbsp; After winning, we were told for the first time in\r\n 153 years new leadership was elected from the floor and not from the Nominating Committee’s recommendations which the old leadership team controlled.&nbsp; Unfortunately last year our president candidate lost by a few votes, but myself, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Vice\r\n President and the EVP were elected by very slim margins.&nbsp; That president and the Cabal were diametrically opposed to the Vice Presidents so we steam rolled over the president and the remnants of the old leaders to start exposing what was going on and making\r\n changes for the good of the members.&nbsp; The EVP was extremely supportive.<u></u><u></u></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;color:#1f497d\"><u></u>&nbsp;<u></u></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;color:#1f497d\">Our Bylaws do not allow for an easy process to terminate board members because they are elected by the general membership.&nbsp; And yes, the general membership re-elected\r\n some of the problem members again after a major campaign was launched to educate our members to vote for NRA 2.0 candidates for continued change.&nbsp; The President has great powers when it comes to how the board operates.&nbsp; As President, I assigned the problem\r\n board members to zero committees, effectively neutering them.&nbsp; The board’s Ethics Committee will be looking into their past transgressions for further action.<u></u><u></u></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;color:#1f497d\"><u></u>&nbsp;<u></u></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;color:#1f497d\">Today going forward the NRA has three principled, business leaders as Board Officers (no more lawyers or professors).&nbsp; I appointed strong chairman and good members\r\n to all the governance committees.&nbsp; There is now zero tolerance going forward for any malfeasance, shenanigans, self-dealing, &nbsp;etc.&nbsp; The Officers and Board members are unpaid, volunteer positions.&nbsp; I put in over 70 hours per week, plus evenings out and lots\r\n of travel.&nbsp; While as a board member, NRA never paid for any of my travel costs, meals, etc., I paid for them out of my own pocket.&nbsp; Even now with significant travel, I still pay my own way, as do the other Officers.&nbsp;\r\n<u></u><u></u></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;color:#1f497d\"><u></u>&nbsp;<u></u></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;color:#1f497d\">When I testified in front of the judge, I said “… this is a new NRA, NRA 2.0.”&nbsp;

He had a video discussing this (Wayne) and he contacted someone on the board to ask - would you be willing to discuss\r\n - true or false. Long story short - he said no one ever contacted him - so he &quot;dropped&quot; the NRA - as a sponsor. His point was - I don't recommend someone or something - unless I feel certain I understand them or their operation. NUMEROUS Youtubers were bashing\r\n the NRA.&nbsp;<br>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>My comments to them and their posting was - largest target of the anti-gun world is the NRA - and believed they would fix things. One youtuber said - vote for me as an open candidate on your ballot - and I will fix it. He was bashed etc. Never made it.&nbsp;<br>\r\n</div>\r\n<div><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>TODAY<br>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>You had the first discussion about the past - but this was just recent (shocking to me).. YOU NEED to &quot;put to bed&quot; the Wayne LaPierre story. CAN YOU? Can you at least give some specifics? This is similar to the mess with Epstien - it really is NOT about\r\n the perv - it is ABOUT building TRUST. We need a NRA person tell the mess that happened - it was &quot;true&quot; or partially true etc. - and as you did in this current edition - AND this is how we are preventing it.&nbsp;<br>\r\n</div>\r\n<div><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND - you select a few Youtube stars (Hickok45 maybe Branden Hurrarah) and have a remote or personal interview and ANSWER their questions - to be released to the public. YOU WILL BUILD SO MUCH TRUST - if properly done - and think about\r\n the NUMBER of people you will address with a few people. YOU HAVE TO TELL THE TRUTH - Wayne did spend $20,000 on flowers - or whatever it is - you cant say - I dont want to address the past - we need to face the future. NO. You must tell SOME nasty numbers\r\n - we lost $xxxxx due to salaries or private planes etc. etc. DO SOME OF THAT. Then tell how we proceed forward. Why I heard the NRA did not support so and so - when he was arrested? Maybe these youtubers can give you a list of questions - and then go from\r\n there.&nbsp;<br>\r\n</div>\r\n<div><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>Stewart Dunaway<br>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>The Villages, FL<br>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>(919) 619-3865</div>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n"

I believe this nonsense began with Bush Jr and the farce of post 9/11 legislation that allowed for the Patriot Act and created DHS. We are no more\r\n secure a nation now than we were then.

You saw what happened with much more powerful board members like Col. North.&nbsp;\r\n In the early days leadership kept the board in the dark like a mushroom and fed us very little information, or lies.&nbsp; Old leadership assured us everything was fine and we had little hard materials at the time to question them. &nbsp;In addition, our attorney said\r\n we could not speak out during the court case, that was bullshit advice too. &nbsp;Once some of us got access to factual information, mainly from the court proceedings, we could rise up and educate other board members while still being told everything is fine.&nbsp;\r\n They fed us all crap.&nbsp; Since I was out spoken and elected 1<sup>st</sup> VP I was hauled in by the NY AG for\r\n</span><span style=\"color:#1F4E79;mso-style-textfill-fill-color:#1F4E79;mso-style-textfill-fill-alpha:100.0%\">depositions and then last fall in front of the judge for over two hours.\r\n<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\"><span style=\"color:#1F4E79;mso-style-textfill-fill-color:#1F4E79;mso-style-textfill-fill-alpha:100.0%\"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\"><span style=\"color:#1F4E79;mso-style-textfill-fill-color:#1F4E79;mso-style-textfill-fill-alpha:100.0%\">That is why my President's columns are addressing Transparency, Accountability and Integrity.&nbsp; I think you will like my future third\r\n column, it further talks about Accountability and Integrity.&nbsp; We have implemented many changes both proactively and by judge's order.&nbsp; In addition to those policies and procedures, I have taken the initiative (with the support of the Vice Presidents) to isolate\r\n and neuter the handful of board members that are still on the board who were complicit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\"><span style=\"color:#1F4E79;mso-style-textfill-fill-color:#1F4E79;mso-style-textfill-fill-alpha:100.0%\"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\"><span style=\"color:#1F4E79;mso-style-textfill-fill-color:#1F4E79;mso-style-textfill-fill-alpha:100.0%\">Our Bylaws do not allow for an easy process to terminate board members because they are elected by the general membership.&nbsp; And yes,\r\n the general membership re-elected some of those problem members again after a major campaign was launched to educate our members to vote for NRA 2.0 candidates for continued change.&nbsp; The President has great powers when it comes to how the board operates.&nbsp;\r\n As President, I assigned the problem board members to zero committees, effectively neutering them.&nbsp; The board’s Ethics Committee will be looking into their past transgressions for further action.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\">This is prevalent in many non profits and church space.

The issues with past leadership was allowed because the board did not hold them accountable. This is prevalent in many non profits and church space. Wayne Lapierre should actually be behind bars for theft and several board members and other leaders should join him. Our dues are not meant to pay for lavish lifestyles. I am also in disagreement with the NRA and its blanket approval of all things GOP and especially President Trump. This man is NOT good for America as a whole. As such I would request that my contact information be removed from the roles of the NRA until the time that the organization decides to embrace all Americans. \r\n\r\nDarin Nunn"

I have been a member for a long time, and decided to become a Life Member this year to further support the NRA and the great work it does to protect our 2nd Amendment right.   \r\nAfter I made that decision , and I don’t recall where I obtained the information from, it stated that the President of the NRA receives an annual salary of over $1,000,000 yearly.   Upon learning that, I was extremely disappointed and angry.   \r\nI fully understand that good pay attracts good people, but no one is worth over a   million dollars in a completely voluntary organization.   \r\nI hope you can confirm that the new leadership of this organization is not being paid those levels of pay, while at the same time “asking/begging “ members to send in more money to support the NRA.\r\nI joined because I believed this organization is desperately needed to continue the fight against gun confiscation and unconstitutional state/local gun control.    I still believe that with all my being, but I will not support an organization that pays unreasonable salaries and outrageous “perks”.     \r\nPlease be transparent, as you promised in the August addition of Freedom and let the membership know their contributions and dues are not supporting outrageous salaries and perks.\r\nThank you for taking time to read/hear my comments and I, like many other members, would welcome the openness of what “our” organization is paying its top executives . \r\n\r\nThank you, \r\nRoy J Mikesh \r\nSent from my iPhone\r\n"

As far as the 2nd Amendment, (and all the Constitution for\r\n that matter) go, we have to stop compromising our rights away. All attacks on our Constitution have to be met with an &quot;all or nothing&quot; wall. I am not talking about trying to expand our 2nd Amendment rights, just enforcing the ones that it gives us. Chipping\r\n away at laws that violate the Constitution has not worked. The only way to stop the anti-gunners is with a full frontal assault. Sue them in the courts, make public any elected officials comments or actions that violate the 2nd Amendment, and I mean loudly.\r\n Use You Tube, Twitter, X, legacy media, local media, bill boards, any means available to get the truth about gun violence out to the public. If any organization tries to censor what you are saying, sue them to for violation of our 1st Amendment rights. No\r\n one has the right to censor or restrict speech just because they don't like it or they don't agree with it or it makes someone out there uncomfortable. The truth usually does all of those things, at least until it becomes accepted by the majority. We all have\r\n to get more vocal and the way to get there is for organizations like yours to start doing that and encouraging their members to do the same by providing them with ways to do it and even a priority list of things to get loud about. I am one of the ones who\r\n canceled my life membership years ago due to how the NRA was being run and managed. The only reason I rejoined was so I could become an RSO at the local range, (we moved 3 years ago so I had to find a new place to shoot). I am encouraged by what has been happening\r\n at the NRA and by the words of yours and the board members and I am truly hopeful that those words continue to become actions.</div>\r\n<div><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"ydpf5bd3de8signature\">Allan Collier unclealtkp@yahoo.com</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n"

          "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nAfter reading the \"President's Column\" in the August ed, I felt I should \r\nwrite this email.\r\n\r\nFinally after a year and a half post Wayne's resignation, an article in \r\nthe NRA magazine that actually offers a solid discussion on what is \r\nhappening under new leadership. Over the past year and a half it has \r\nfelt like the NRA is trying to just quietly bury this debacle and move \r\non from it. Oh sure, there would be a brief mention in the magazine that \r\nthings were changing, that there was a new board. But for the most part, \r\nit has felt like the NRA is just trying to put the story behind them and \r\npretend it never happened. Since 2019 we have known that Wayne was a \r\ncrook. And yet for years the NRA did nothing. As donations and sponsors \r\ndried up, as the NRA's credibility was dragged through the mud, nothing \r\nchanged. The NRA refused to listen to thousands of card carrying NRA \r\nmembers. It took a liberal prosecutor to finally get change to happen, \r\nwtf??\r\n\r\nUsually I scan read the EVP and President's columns, they're usually \r\npretty boilerplate. But in the middle of scan reading your article, I \r\nstopped and started again from the beginning. I was very impressed by it \r\nand it actually made me think, for the first time in 6+ years, about \r\ngiving to the NRA again. But I also had to ask, why it's taken this long \r\nto see this kind of article, and frankly, why there aren't more. The NRA \r\nspent years defending Wayne. Geez, the NRA statements page with Wayne's \r\nresignation makes him sound like a good man. Whatever good he may have \r\ndone for the organization, he squandered away. He deserves no credit, \r\nhe's a liar and crook.\r\n\r\nChris Cox, he saw what was happening, he tried to speak up. Was he \r\noffered his job back? Has there at least been an apology to him?\r\n\r\nOliver North, he reportedly tried to expose Wayne and save the NRA. \r\nInstead he was slandered and forced out. Has he been apologized to?\r\n\r\nThese questions should be getting answered. I'm sure other members could \r\nname more issues, these are just the top ones that have been in the back \r\nof my mind. And not in an email reply to me. I mean these answers should \r\nbe in the magazine and the NRA website. No vague, \"Oh trust us, \r\neverything's different now.\". Yes, that's good, and your article did a \r\nLOT to show the changes being made. But what about the past 6 years that \r\nthe NRA refused to change.\r\n\r\nTell us more. What happened? You said in the article that you were a \r\nboard member during this period, where was your voice back then? There's \r\nso much over the past 6+ years that we don't understand. So many \r\nquestions that need answering. Shine a light on it. Dedicate a column \r\nevery month for the next year on explaining how things could have gone \r\nso wrong. Like I said I'd like to know what amends have been made with \r\nCox and North. That for me was the moment I knew the NRA was corrupt to \r\nthe core.\r\n\r\nIn closing, your article made a difference to me, although it is a year \r\nlate (yes I know you didn't become President till recently), but one of \r\nthe former executives should have written an article like it. But more \r\nis owed to us.\r\n\r\nRegards, Jonathan, Life Member\r\n\r\n"

I've been waiting on a response,&nbsp; something from the NRA.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>Your words feel sincere. WE were let down by the most popular person for a long time. Perhaps it was the arduous era of the New York Attorney General and Brewer Attorneys &amp; Councelors pressure, which made him confess?? It's done!&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>We need to pick up the pieces and learn from this, but be cautious!&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>Yes, will take time and winning our TRUST again, will take major doing!!!!!!!&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>In my opinion,&nbsp; I feel confident enough to say, I'm WILLING to give the NRA another chance.

We have one, HGCA in Houston,&nbsp; TX. Mr. Nick Combs is our President.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>ncombs@comcast.net.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>We had a rep from NRA, and well,&nbsp; quit coming to our meetings, years ago!!&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>We meet the 2nd Wednesday of each month.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>Knights of Columbus&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>607 E.

Even\r\n got my LTC license! Going to NRA Conventions, blew me away!!!!!!&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>I'm suggesting,&nbsp; use your current members to help get the message out of the truly improved NRA and what's been changed, what's ahead, and&nbsp; how WE can be involved.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>Eddie Eagle was taught in Jr. High, is this still happening?? What about programs, &quot;Refuse to be a victim &quot;, scholarship,&nbsp; awards, contests, recreational shooting, law enforcement,&nbsp; military,&nbsp; security,&nbsp; so many! Get our fire lit. Give us something WE\r\n can ALL benefit from. Those whom we've lost, will want to come back....</div>\r\n<div><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>Don't just say it, show it, mean it, just do it! Get membership up past 5 million already! Offer unbelievable offers!! Help us to believe in you, again....</div>\r\n<div><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>Talk to Tom Selleck, who used to be on the Board.&nbsp; Get him involved again. Clint Eastwood, hec, speak with him!! Promote, promote, promote!!!</div>\r\n<div><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>Gun manufacturers,&nbsp; especially those who come to conventions, they need NRA, now, more than ever!!&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>And yes, speak with our President Donald Trump!!!&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>And WHEN, is the NRA MOVING TO TEXAS?????????

          "body": "Dear President Bachenberg,\r\n\r\nI am a member and Board of Director’s member of a 501c7 gun club in Indiana.\r\nOur club incorporated in 1941 and is one of the oldest NRA Good Club.\r\nUp until recently, NRA membership was a requirement, among other things, for an applicant to be considered for membership, as our club of over 200 members are required to maintain their NRA membership to remain a member of the club.\r\nWe have our liability insurance through Lockton and, until recently, Lockton required 100% of our membership to be NRA members.\r\nI’m now being told that Lockton no longer has that NRA membership requirement.\r\nBeing a “gun club”, obtaining liability insurance has been both challenging and expensive and has been an important factor in continuing to require NRA membership from all of our members.\r\nHowever, now that Lockton has apparently discontinued their NRA membership requirement, there are several on our Board who are advocating removing the NRA membership requirement for our members from our bylaws.\r\nThe Club will maintain its membership, but, if passed, our members will be free to not renew their NRA membership when it is due.\r\nGiven the bitter taste many of our members have for past NRA indiscretions, I’m afraid many will opt out of renewing.\r\nPlease help me, if you can, with any direct NRA benefits our club will loose (since obtaining insurance is no longer at issue) when and if we are no longer a “Gold Club”.\r\nThank you in advance for any help you can provide.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid A. Kurth\r\n#37423415\r\nSent from my iPhone\r\n"
