My father introduced me to hunting and fishing at a very early age, and I've done the\n same with my son and grandson. Looking back forty years or so, Mario Cuomo was the governor of New York State. His ego was as large as his liberalism, and he enjoyed sparing with the media at almost daily press conferences, where he would expound on the superiority\n of his policies and ideas. The press conference that is still fresh in my mind was about gun control. Reporters were asking about self defense, the shooting sports and other aspects of owning a gun. His outlook was that no one should own a gun. One reporter\n asked about hunters. His reply? &quot;All hunters want to do is drink beer and cheat on their wives.&quot; And he was serious. He tried (lamely) to walk it back the next day, but by then I had joined the NRA.</div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\" data-setdir=\"false\"><br>\n</div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\" data-setdir=\"false\">Back then I realized that many people didn't approve of gun ownership, but it didn't really affect me personally until I realized the governor of my state might be coming after my guns. At that time the NRA required a sponsor\n to join. A neighbor gladly obliged, and I've been an annual member almost continually since then. I dropped my membership for a period of time since although I firmly believe the NRA is one of the only organizations (the New York Rifle and Pistol Association\n being another) that will stand and fight for my second amendment rights. Back then I was raising a family and scratching to make ends meet. So I deleted a few memberships and subscriptions for a few years until I was better able to afford them.</div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\" data-setdir=\"false\"><br>\n</div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\" data-setdir=\"false\">I worked in New York State government for thirty years and witnessed bureaucracy that at times was horrible and at other times promising Towards the end of my career I worked for a commissioner who, like you, asked for input.\n And he got it. His method of addressing problems was not to criticize or attack persons bringing subjects to his attention but rather to ask staff to work together to solve them. His message? Where do we have opportunities for improvement? A slightly different\n twist on the question of what 's wrong in our organization and who's to blame for it.</div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\" data-setdir=\"false\"><br>\n</div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\" data-setdir=\"false\">It's in this sprit of looking for opportunities for improvement that I offer a few observations for you to consider. First, I realize you need money to survive and carry out your mission. Every (and I mean every) piece of\n mail I get from you, whether it be from the main organization or a sub group like the NRA-ILA, is asking for donations. It's a common complaint I hear in the fall, and is one reason people are hesitant to join. (&quot;All they want is money, and I don't know what\n they do with it&quot;) I point out that the America Hunter magazine has sections devoted to NRA activities such as court challenges and regional information around the country and I also make sure there are several copies of this magazine lying around my hunting\n camp.</div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\" data-setdir=\"false\"><br>\n</div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\" data-setdir=\"false\">While I think of it, I have often wished I had some window decals for my vehicles. You used to send them with my annual membership renewal but with your often offered multi-year membership deals that seems to have fallen by\n the wayside. But wait, you say. You can go to the NRA store and get some. I don't think paying $6.95 for a small window decal and then shelling out $10.95 to ship it is a very good deal. &quot;I'm the NRA and I vote!&quot; was a good one but has since come off with\n many washings.&nbsp;</div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\" data-setdir=\"false\"><br>\n</div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\" data-setdir=\"false\">Lastly I would like to encourage the NRA to once again have regional offices at least in those states where the attack on the second amendment is most egregious. Again, I realize this takes money, but here in New York we are\n faced with Governor Hochul who has taken gun control to an entirely new level with passage of the Safe Act and accompanying legislation. There used to be an office in Albany that was helpful to me years ago. Perhaps you could work something out with the NY\n Rifle and Pistol Association. Just a thought.</div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\" data-setdir=\"false\"><br>\n</div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\" data-setdir=\"false\">Before I fire off a note to J. Scott Olmstead about missing the point in a letter he received about squirrel hunting last month, I want to wish you luck in your new endeavor. No need to respond to this. Glad to get it off\n my chest.</div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\" data-setdir=\"false\"><br>\n</div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\" data-setdir=\"false\">Kenneth Goeldner</div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\" data-setdir=\"false\">000018670846</div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\" data-setdir=\"false\"><br>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

&nbsp; &nbsp;I'm only a few months shy of my 75<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;birthday, and just had my 40<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;anniversary of being a Life member of the NRA.&nbsp; Raised in a small coal town in Tioga County, Pennsylvania,&nbsp; I joined the NRA shortly after graduation in 1968.&nbsp; &nbsp;Not\n sure the real reason, but they had a neat magazine (American Rifleman) that all of my shooting buddies read every month.&nbsp; This was back when you had to have another member sponsor you for joining,...and back when they published the names of the winners of\n all those gun raffles the following month after the raffle was over.&nbsp; &nbsp;I never met another member that ever won anything from the NRA.&nbsp; &nbsp;There were the Cincinnati accords, the birth of the ILA, and later the shakeup there.&nbsp;</div>\n<div style=\"font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif;

&nbsp;In retirement now, 20 years total Naval service, 28 years in the nuclear industry, 42 years in the gun business and FFL holder (inspected numerous times by ATF, and never once felt I was dealing with &quot;jack booted thugs&quot; as LaPierre called them), 35 years\n volunteering in Scouting, NRA Rifle, Shotgun, and RSO qualified, high school coach on shotgun team, current South Carolina Hunter Education instructor, and years of range service at scout camps in the summer.&nbsp; &nbsp;Obviously a 'gun guy' like your self, and another\n Pennsylvanian if I remember reading your profile.</div>\n<div style=\"font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\" class=\"elementToProof\">\n&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp;Patiently I waited for a response from the\n NRA in their publications denouncing Trump's lack of leadership on that fateful day.&nbsp; It never came.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>\n<div style=\"font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\" class=\"elementToProof\">\n&nbsp; For four years we had to put up with his rhetoric of a stolen election.&nbsp; &nbsp;The NRA continued to support him solely on his support of the 2<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp;Amendment.&nbsp; &nbsp; This was our 'commander in chief'...the captain of our ship, the general of our forces, watching\n for over three hours as his supporters destroyed the Capitol.&nbsp; &nbsp;This was the greatest public display of Treason that I have witnessed by a public official in my lifetime.&nbsp; &nbsp;He should have been relieved immediately, even with only a few days left in the White\n House.&nbsp; &nbsp; And yet, not a word from the NRA other than praise....and to have his picture on the front cover of their publications just prior to the election??...that was too much.&nbsp; The NRA should have dropped his membership on the spot.&nbsp;</div>\n<div style=\"font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\" class=\"elementToProof\">\n&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>\n<div style=\"font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif;

&nbsp;It will be interesting to read the details of the 'claw back' expenses that are supposed to be published in the official journals as reported in an issue of American Hunter just a couple of months ago.&nbsp;</div>\n<div style=\"font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif;

&nbsp;And still supported by the NRA solely on his support\n for the 2<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp;Amendment.&nbsp; &nbsp;But how about all the rest of the Constitution that he doesn't have knowledge of or totally disregards?&nbsp; &nbsp; Write an executive order for everything, and let the courts challenge it, if you don't get the response you like,\n bash the judges, and...eventually kick it to the Supreme Court.&nbsp; &nbsp;

&nbsp;Put all your political b.s. In one magazine, get it out of AH and AR and give your new director his own platform.&nbsp; The same old stuff\n I've heard for years.&nbsp; &nbsp;I suspect you've lost a lot of advertisers based on the size of my American Hunter magazine alone.&nbsp; It's about half of what it used to be.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div>\n<div style=\"font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\" class=\"elementToProof\">\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The sole reason I haven't cut up my Life Member card and sent half to you and half to Doug is that I have to show a current qualification card at the Scout Camps in order to teach and serve on the gun ranges there.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I know these comments are not those\n that you want or like to hear from an old Life Member but based on your recent comments in your column, I'll bet there are many more like myself.&nbsp;</div>\n<div style=\"font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\" class=\"elementToProof\">\n&nbsp; &nbsp; In closing, I wish you good luck as the new President, as you certainly have your work cut out for you in restoring trust and respect to the organization.&nbsp;</div>\n<div style=\"font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\" class=\"elementToProof\">\nGood hunting up there in Pa.!</div>\n<div style=\"font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\" class=\"elementToProof\">\n<br>\n</div>\n<div style=\"font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\" class=\"elementToProof\">\nStanley M.

The old ways of marketing, by the NRA, has become old, stale and not very effective. This is 2025 and the NRA needs to embrace what this new age of computers, AI, social media and new age marketing\n has to offer. Below are some ideas worth considering to get the NRA back to its glory days.</p>\n<p class=\"gmail-MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0in 0.5in;line-height:115%;font-size:14pt;font-family:&quot;Arial Rounded MT Bold&quot;,sans-serif\">\n1.<span style=\"font-variant-numeric:normal;font-variant-east-asian:normal;font-variant-alternates:normal;font-size-adjust:none;font-kerning:auto;font-feature-settings:normal;font-stretch:normal;font-size:7pt;line-height:normal;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</span>Have every gun store, brick &amp; mortar and online, a voice of the NRA. In my previous email, I mentioned how to set up a website that any retail outlet can access, to enter a member\u2019s NRA number to get an immediate discount of their purchase and to reimburse\n the dealer. Since every membership these days (think Amazon, Costco, Sam\u2019s Club, Walmart&#43;, etc.) pay an annual fee to be a member, charge every retailer and FFL dealer an annual fee of (e.g.) $120 to offer the NRA discount and to receive banners and posters\n about being proud members of the NRA. Use these annual fees to defray the cost of the website and to cover the X% discount for being an NRA member.</p>\n<p class=\"gmail-MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0in 0.5in;line-height:115%;font-size:14pt;font-family:&quot;Arial Rounded MT Bold&quot;,sans-serif\">\n2.<span style=\"font-variant-numeric:normal;font-variant-east-asian:normal;font-variant-alternates:normal;font-size-adjust:none;font-kerning:auto;font-feature-settings:normal;font-stretch:normal;font-size:7pt;line-height:normal;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</span>Offer the participating retailers and FFLs an inside track to NRA supported credit card processing services, business bank accounts by supporting banks, business insurance, liability insurance, internet services, etc. Any service needed for a business\n to operate can be offered to an NRA supporting retail business. This is similar to the NRA insurance offered to gun ranges and clubs where its members are all NRA members.</p>\n<p class=\"gmail-MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0in 0.5in;line-height:115%;font-size:14pt;font-family:&quot;Arial Rounded MT Bold&quot;,sans-serif\">\n3.<span style=\"font-variant-numeric:normal;font-variant-east-asian:normal;font-variant-alternates:normal;font-size-adjust:none;font-kerning:auto;font-feature-settings:normal;font-stretch:normal;font-size:7pt;line-height:normal;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</span>Offer, at the retail outlets, an NRA Visa/Master Card underwritten by an internet bank that specializes in the new credit/light credit market. These finance companies offer credit cars with a limited $500 to $1000 credit limit for new credit buyers.\n Use the gun purchase as collateral (unenforceable) and give these retail shops a way to sell more guns to more people or to upsell a buyer from a \u201ccheap\u201d purchase to a \u201cbetter\u201done with a new credit card issued THRU a lender recognized by the NRA. Of course,\n a membership would also be needed to qualify but it can be added to the new credit card.\n</p>\n<p class=\"gmail-MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0in 0.5in;line-height:115%;font-size:14pt;font-family:&quot;Arial Rounded MT Bold&quot;,sans-serif\">\n4.<span style=\"font-variant-numeric:normal;font-variant-east-asian:normal;font-variant-alternates:normal;font-size-adjust:none;font-kerning:auto;font-feature-settings:normal;font-stretch:normal;font-size:7pt;line-height:normal;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</span>Make the NRA membership card a valuable commodity to the membership. For example, look at how the AARP offers its members hundreds of saving options. Have the NRA membership card be as valuable as an AARP card to the membership. Offer sponsored discounts\n to specific gas stations, restaurants, fast food joints, etc. For members on the go, visit a Cracker Barrel restaurant, present your NRA card and get a 10% discount on the food bill. The restaurant gets the increased business from NRA members because the NRA\n Rifleman magazine publishes a page(s) of sponsors that support the NRA and who we should patronize. NRA members are very supportive of those who believe in us. We are a loyal group. The NRA card can be digital as well as physical and can have a QR code to\n be used easily. This is 2025.</p>\n<p class=\"gmail-MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0in 0.5in;line-height:115%;font-size:14pt;font-family:&quot;Arial Rounded MT Bold&quot;,sans-serif\">\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"gmail-MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0in 0.5in;line-height:115%;font-size:14pt;font-family:&quot;Arial Rounded MT Bold&quot;,sans-serif\">\nBy making being an NRA member a privilege instead of just another bill, the NRA can become as big and powerful as any organization that provides value in membership. All it takes is some clever, 2025 type marketing, to get the ball rolling. With social media\n taking over, the right marketing can snowball immediate results.</p>\n<p class=\"gmail-MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0in 0.5in;line-height:115%;font-size:14pt;font-family:&quot;Arial Rounded MT Bold&quot;,sans-serif\">\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"gmail-MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0in 0.5in;line-height:115%;font-size:14pt;font-family:&quot;Arial Rounded MT Bold&quot;,sans-serif\">\nHowever, the core of the NRA mission must be front and center. That can never change but offering ways for the membership to save money is what it takes to get them to want to join us.</p>\n<p class=\"gmail-MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0in 0.5in;line-height:115%;font-size:14pt;font-family:&quot;Arial Rounded MT Bold&quot;,sans-serif\">\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"gmail-MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0in 0.5in;line-height:115%;font-size:14pt;font-family:&quot;Arial Rounded MT Bold&quot;,sans-serif\">\nLarry Hall</p>\n<p class=\"gmail-MsoListParagraphCxSpLast\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 10pt 0.5in;line-height:115%;font-size:14pt;font-family:&quot;Arial Rounded MT Bold&quot;,sans-serif\">\nPh)860-921-3791</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<br>\n<div class=\"gmail_quote gmail_quote_container\">\n<div dir=\"ltr\" class=\"gmail_attr\">On Mon, Jul 28, 2025 at 8:47\u202fPM NRA President &lt;<a href=\"mailto:President@nradirector.com\">President@nradirector.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br>\n</div>\n<blockquote class=\"gmail_quote\" style=\"margin:0px 0px 0px 0.8ex;border-left:1px solid rgb(204,204,204);padding-left:1ex\">\n<div class=\"msg3564087945343882981\">\n<div lang=\"EN-US\">\n<div class=\"m_3564087945343882981WordSection1\">\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;color:rgb(31,73,125)\">Good evening Larry, thank you for writing and expressing your views.&nbsp; We need honest communications to fix problems and restore confidence!</span><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;color:rgb(31,73,125)\"><u></u><u></u></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a name=\"m_3564087945343882981__MailEndCompose\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;color:rgb(31,73,125)\"><u></u>&nbsp;<u></u></span></a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;color:rgb(31,73,125)\">Not sure where to start so I\u2019m embedding my responses.<u></u><u></u></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;color:rgb(31,73,125)\"><u></u>&nbsp;<u></u></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">From:</span></b><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"> Larry Hall [mailto:<a href=\"mailto:larryh1108@gmail.com\" target=\"_blank\">larryh1108@gmail.com</a>]\n<br>\n<b>Sent:</b> Sunday, July 27, 2025 12:18 PM<br>\n<b>To:</b> NRA President &lt;President@NRADirector.com&gt;<br>\n<b>Subject:</b> Requested letter/suggestion<u></u><u></u></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><u></u>&nbsp;<u></u></p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:10pt;line-height:115%\"><span style=\"font-size:13.5pt;line-height:115%;font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;color:rgb(70,71,74);background:rgb(248,248,248)\">Hi,</span><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Arial Rounded MT Bold&quot;,sans-serif\"><u></u><u></u></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:10pt;line-height:115%\"><span style=\"font-size:13.5pt;line-height:115%;font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;color:rgb(70,71,74);background:rgb(248,248,248)\">I am an NRA Benefactor Lifetime Member and have been for many years.\n I read and appreciate your letter to us in the August 2025 edition.
